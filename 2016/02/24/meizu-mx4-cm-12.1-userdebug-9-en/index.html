<h2>Announcement changelog</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: All times in this announcement are UTC+8.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>2016/02/25 05:00 First (translated) release</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes since last release</h2>

<p>This is a fairly small release with only blob updates and upstream framework
updates; however it's been a long time since the last English post, so I'd
introduce the changes in the meantime also.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> Synced with upstream sources as of 2016/02/18</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong> Blobs and prebuilt kernel synced to Flyme 5.6.2.16 (thanks to @ccfxny)</li>
</ul>

<p>(20151023)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> Double-tap to wake and Prevent accidental wake-up (find under <code>Display &amp; lights</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Some SIM cards not being recognized</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Some videos crashing app when played</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Bluetooth audio</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Unable to connect with some Bluetooth devices</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Step counter couldn't be accessed sometimes</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Wakelocks statistics not available</li>
</ul>

<p>(20160106)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Power-off charging animation not displaying correctly</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Proximity sensor and tap-to-wake broken after ending a call; fixed by re-calibrating proximity sensor every time a call ends. Please don't cover the proximity sensor or otherwise put anything close to the sensor at the end of a call.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> USB charge only option is fixed. According to test, the UI may get stuck if you switch back from charge only; re-plugging the USB cable would fix it. Thanks to @ccfxny for the fix!</li>
</ul>

<p>(20160112)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Bluetooth regression (thanks to @ccfxny!)</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Intermittent DHCP failures over WiFi</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> Factory reset no longer wipes internal storage; actually this got fixed some time ago but not tested until this version</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong> Switched <code>libui.so</code> to compiled version</li>
<li><strong>Remove</strong> No longer integrating Xposed due to some users reporting decreased stability. Please flash it yourself if you truly feel the need.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs and limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Some people may find the minimum volume to be too high. This is due to bad defaults pre-set by MTK; you can fix it yourself by entering MTK's engineer mode (dialing <code>*#*#ENGMODE#*#*</code>) <strong>in Flyme</strong> (the engineer mode is too invasive to be ported), swiping to the <code>Hardware</code> tab then <code>Audio</code> item, after that select the <code>Media</code> mode and manually toggle each level's hardware output level. Pretty terrible UI but at least things can be fixed.)</li>
<li>Some users may have to toggle flight mode to restore cellular connectivity on reboot</li>
<li>Some users are unable to auto-configure their SMSC numbers</li>
<li>Some large apps can't be installed causing crash</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mega.nz/#F!1p1kkBZT!wqml0aCll14yA3E4JlMPwg">MEGA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Checksums:</p>

<pre><code>
</code></pre>

<h2>Flashing</h2>

<p>For MX4 Ubuntu Edition users, your bootloaders are already unlocked, so just flash the stock recovery provided and proceed. (3rd-party recoveries may be provided by some other people; I myself have no time for that. Graphics was broken at my last attempt to do this.)</p>

<p>For users of ordinary version of Meizu MX4, you need to have your bootloader unlocked, the tutorial can be found <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/meizu-mx/general/tutorial-bootloader-unlocking-mx4-m1-t3201715)">here</a>.
After unlocking just flash as usual; remember to wipe your <code>/data</code> partition if
you're coming from Flyme or Ubuntu Touch or generally any incompatible system.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cellular network</strong>
<ul>
<li>There may well be no signal at first boot, please <strong>toggle on and off flight mode</strong> for the telephony component to re-initialize itself.</li>
<li>SIM card may also go unrecognized after reboot, just do the same and the problem should hopefully disappear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>more to come later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting</h2>

<p>I do Android porting mainly for personal use and fun, but as a matter of fact
I sometimes find myself struggling to achieve the standards I strive for, as
a graduate student still learning his way into the industry and having things
to take care of besides coding. If you appreciate my work, please kindly
consider donating something equivalent to a beer or two. I will use the
donations to support my porting work and studies. PayPal and Alipay payments are
accepted:</p>
