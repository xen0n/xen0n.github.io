Due to the implementation of MTK secure restricted boot, the device will be hard-bricked if the RSA signature verification failed. You can&amp;rsquo;t even recharge the battery as the verification code runs very early, even earlier than initialization of peripherals. Flashing using SP Flash Tool wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work either because the Boot ROM (BROM) is locked on the hardware level.</description></item></channel></rss>
