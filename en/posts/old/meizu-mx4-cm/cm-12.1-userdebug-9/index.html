Please don’t cover the proximity sensor or otherwise put anything close to the sensor at the end of a call. Fix USB charge only option is fixed. According to test, the UI may get stuck if you switch back from charge only; re-plugging the USB cable would fix it. Thanks to @ccfxny for the fix!  (20160112)\n Fix Bluetooth regression (thanks to @ccfxny!) Fix Intermittent DHCP failures over WiFi Fix Factory reset no longer wipes internal storage; actually this got fixed some time ago but not tested until this version Add Switched libui.so to compiled version Remove No longer integrating Xposed due to some users reporting decreased stability. Please flash it yourself if you truly feel the need.  Known bugs and limitations  Some people may find the minimum volume to be too high. This is due to bad defaults pre-set by MTK; you can fix it yourself by entering MTK’s engineer mode (dialing *#*#ENGMODE#*#*) in Flyme (the engineer mode is too invasive to be ported), swiping to the Hardware tab then Audio item, after that select the Media mode and manually toggle each level’s hardware output level. Pretty terrible UI but at least things can be fixed.) Some users may have to toggle flight mode to restore cellular connectivity on reboot Some users are unable to auto-configure their SMSC numbers Some large apps can’t be installed causing crash etc.  Downloading  MEGA  Checksums:\nFlashing For MX4 Ubuntu Edition users, your bootloaders are already unlocked, so just flash the stock recovery provided and proceed. (3rd-party recoveries may be provided by some other people; I myself have no time for that. Graphics was broken at my last attempt to do this.)\nFor users of ordinary version of Meizu MX4, you need to have your bootloader unlocked, the tutorial can be found [here][unlocking-tutorial]. After unlocking just flash as usual; remember to wipe your /data partition if you’re coming from Flyme or Ubuntu Touch or generally any incompatible system.\n[unlocking-tutorial]: http://forum.xda-developers.com/meizu-mx/general/tutorial-bootloader-unlocking-mx4-m1-t3201715)\nNotes  Cellular network  There may well be no signal at first boot, please toggle on and off flight mode for the telephony component to re-initialize itself. SIM card may also go unrecognized after reboot, just do the same and the problem should hopefully disappear.   more to come later  Supporting I do Android porting mainly for personal use and fun, but as a matter of fact I sometimes find myself struggling to achieve the standards I strive for, as a graduate student still learning his way into the industry and having things to take care of besides coding.
