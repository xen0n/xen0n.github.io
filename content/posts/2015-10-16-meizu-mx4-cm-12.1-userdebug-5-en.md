## Announcement changelog

* 2015/10/16 04:00 First (translated) release


## Changes since last release

* **Add** Synced with upstream sources as of 2015/10/15
* **Add** Blobs and prebuilt kernel synced to Flyme 4.5.7A (round C testing firmware)
* **Fix** Proximity sensor (by auto-calibrating once every boot; for that matter it's better to not cover the phone when you turn on or reboot it)
* **Fix** FLAC playback
* **Fix** Re-enable configuration of button backlight (still disabling it by default)
* **Fix** Extremely slow charging when charging current is low (fixed in prebuilt kernel, not CM work)


## Known bugs and limitations

* Still some (many?) SIM cards have broken cellular data connectivity
* Some users may have to toggle flight mode to restore cellular connectivity on reboot
* Some users are unable to auto-configure their SMSC numbers
* Some apps (Facebook, etc.) can't playback video (regression)
* Unable to revert from setting USB option to Charging-only
* Audio is not properly re-routed on connecting Bluetooth audio
* Unable to pair with some Bluetooth (BLE?) devices
* etc.

## Flashing

For MX4 Ubuntu Edition users, your bootloaders are already unlocked, so just flash the stock recovery provided and proceed. (3rd-party recoveries may be provided by some other people; I myself have no time for that. Graphics was broken at my last attempt to do this.)

For users of ordinary version of Meizu MX4, you need to have your bootloader unlocked, the tutorial can be found [here][unlocking-tutorial].
After unlocking just flash as usual; remember to wipe your `/data` partition if
you're coming from Flyme or Ubuntu Touch or generally any incompatible system.

## Notes

* **Cellular network**
    - There may well be no signal at first boot, please **toggle on and off flight mode** for the telephony component to re-initialize itself.
    - SIM card may also go unrecognized after reboot, just do the same and the problem should hopefully disappear.
* more to come later


## Supporting

I do Android porting mainly for personal use and fun, but as a matter of fact
I sometimes find myself struggling to achieve the standards I strive for, as
a graduate student still learning his way into the industry and having things
to take care of besides coding. If you appreciate my work, please kindly
consider donating something equivalent to a beer or two. I will use the
donations to support my porting work and studies. PayPal and Alipay payments are
accepted:
