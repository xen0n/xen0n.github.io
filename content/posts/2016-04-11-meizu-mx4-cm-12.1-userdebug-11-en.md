## Announcement changelog

*NOTE: All times in this announcement are UTC+8.*

* 2016/04/12 00:20 First (translated) release


## Changes since last release

As CM13.0 is out and the port is slowly going, the CM12.1 branch is now in
maintenance mode. Note that due to camera blob compatibility problems and
having to write my papers, CM13.0 porting is paused until June or maybe July.

* **Add** Synced with upstream sources as of 2016/04/11
* **Add** Blobs and prebuilt kernel synced to Flyme 5.6.4.7


## Known bugs and limitations

* Some people may find the minimum volume to be too high. This is due to bad defaults pre-set by MTK; you can fix it yourself by entering MTK's engineer mode (dialing `*#*#ENGMODE#*#*`) **in Flyme** (the engineer mode is too invasive to be ported), swiping to the `Hardware` tab then `Audio` item, after that select the `Media` mode and manually toggle each level's hardware output level. Pretty terrible UI but at least things can be fixed.)
* Some users may have to toggle flight mode to restore cellular connectivity on reboot
* Some users are unable to auto-configure their SMSC numbers
* Some large apps can't be installed causing crash
* etc.

## Flashing

For MX4 Ubuntu Edition users, your bootloaders are already unlocked, so just flash the stock recovery provided and proceed. (3rd-party recoveries may be provided by some other people; I myself have no time for that. Graphics was broken at my last attempt to do this.)

For users of ordinary version of Meizu MX4, you need to have your bootloader unlocked, the tutorial can be found [here][unlocking-tutorial].
After unlocking just flash as usual; remember to wipe your `/data` partition if
you're coming from Flyme or Ubuntu Touch or generally any incompatible system.

[unlocking-tutorial]: http://forum.xda-developers.com/meizu-mx/general/tutorial-bootloader-unlocking-mx4-m1-t3201715)


## Notes

* **Cellular network**
    - There may be no signal at first boot, if the problem doesn't resolve in 40 seconds then please **toggle on and off flight mode** for the telephony component to re-initialize itself.
    - SIM card may also go unrecognized after reboot, just do the same and the problem should hopefully disappear.
* more to come later


## Supporting

I do Android porting mainly for personal use and fun, but as a matter of fact
I sometimes find myself struggling to achieve the standards I strive for, as
a graduate student still learning his way into the industry and having things
to take care of besides coding. If you appreciate my work, please kindly
consider donating something equivalent to a beer or two. I will use the
donations to support my porting work and studies. PayPal and Alipay payments are
accepted:
